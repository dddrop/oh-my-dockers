# SSL Certificates

This directory contains SSL certificates generated by `mkcert` for local development.

## Certificate Management

### Generate Certificate for a Project

```bash
task cert:generate PROJECT=daily
```

This will generate:
- `daily.local.crt` - Certificate file
- `daily.local.key` - Private key file

The certificate includes a wildcard for subdomains: `*.daily.local`

### List All Certificates

```bash
task cert:list
```

### Remove a Certificate

```bash
task cert:remove DOMAIN=daily.local
```

## Certificate Files

Files in this directory:
- `*.crt` - Certificate files
- `*.key` - Private key files

These files are used by Caddy for HTTPS connections.

## Security Note

These certificates are **only for local development**. They are signed by a local CA installed on your machine and should **never** be used in production.
