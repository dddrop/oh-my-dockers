# Commit All Changes

Please commit all changes. Follow the steps below.

**Execution Steps:**
1. If there are already staged files, commit these files first
2. Then check the remaining changes and commit them by category as needed
3. Each commit should be grouped by logical unit

**Requirements:**
- Use Semantic Commit Message format (e.g., `feat: add new feature`, `fix: fix bug`)
- Each commit should have a single responsibility

## Notes
- Split loosely related changes into different commits
- Review the changes before committing to ensure no unnecessary files are included
