# Time

## Document Timestamps

If time is involved, please use MCP's `get_current_time` to get the time in `Asia/Tokyo`.

The time in the document's meta information is usually in the format: `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`.

## Content Description

When there is no explicit request to estimate time, please do not estimate time, because with the use of AI, time estimation has become less important.
